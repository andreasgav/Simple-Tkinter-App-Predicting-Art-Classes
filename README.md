# Simple-Tkinter-App-Predicting-Art-Classes

  A simple Tkinter software is provided in this example. Its purpose is to make predictions regarding the art class of a given picture, that can be manually browsed through a pc. In order to perform the prediction the software deploys an .h5 file, resulting from a Convolutional Neural Network trained on SeAC dataset (https://github.com/andreasgav/SeAC). The CNN used in this example was an Xception model trained and adjusted to fit the available dataset. The procedure in order to train successfully a model like this and obtain the .h5 file is provided here: https://github.com/andreasgav/Transfer-Learning-using-Xception-for-Art-genre-classification.

This software is producing predictions for a given image in 10 different artistic streams as these were the art genres the pre-trained model was trained in.

- Art Nouveau
- Baroque
- Impressionism
- Italian Renaissance
- Post Impressionism
- Realism
- Rococo
- Romanticism
- Street Art
- Surrealism
