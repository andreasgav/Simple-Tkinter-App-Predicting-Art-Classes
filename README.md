# Simple-Tkinter-App-Predicting-Art-Classes

  A simple Tkinter software is provided in this example. Its purpose is to make predictions regarding the art class of a given picture, that can be manually browsed through a pc. In order to perform the prediction the software deploys an .h5 file, resulting from a Convolutional Neural Network trained on SeAC dataset (https://github.com/andreasgav/SeAC). The CNN used in this example was an Xception model trained and adjusted to fit the available dataset. The procedure in order to train successfully a model like this and obtain the .h5 file is provided here: https://github.com/andreasgav/Transfer-Learning-using-Xception-for-Art-genre-classification.
